Know before you sign! EzTerms is an online platform that helps users understand the most crucial aspects of an online service's privacy policy. We achieve this through our carefully designed criteria, which analyze and categorize clauses found in Terms and Conditions contracts. Clauses that fit our criteria are classified as Danger, Caution, or Safety, based on our assessment of its implications.

## Project Objectives

### Awareness Enhancement

**Boost awareness**: Enhance user knowledge about their privacy and rights, promoting informed choices in using online services.

### Reduction of Unknowing Consent

### Ethical Reconsideration by Companies and Policy Makers

**Promote ethical revisions**: Encourage companies and policymakers to reassess the terms and conditions they require, aiming for more ethical and transparent agreements.
